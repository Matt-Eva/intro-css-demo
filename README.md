# Intro to CSS

This application serves and an introduction to fundamental CSS concepts, including CSS selectors, writing CSS, the Box Model, and other fundamental styling attributes in CSS. I'd recommend forking, cloning, and opening this repository as you read along, so you can use the code files as reference.

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" - it's the styling language of the web. We use it in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to make dynamic, appealing, easily navigable webpages. If HTML is the bones of a webpage, then CSS is the flesh of a webpage. (And frontend JavaScript is the nervous system and your backend is the brain.)

In order to style our webpage, we attach CSS styles to our specific HTML elements - think `<div>, <h1>, <p>, and <img>` elements, among many others. There are two essential steps to connecting our HTML elements to their corresponding CSS styling instructions - connecting our HTML and CSS files, and using the appropriate CSS Selectors.

## Connecting HTML and CSS Files

When building out HTML for your webpage, there are a few sections that you'll likely fill out before you jump in to actually creating HTML elements. One of these sections is the `<head>` section. You'll connect your CSS to your HTML using a link tag in this head section. Your head section will likely look like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta name="description" content=""/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
    <title>Title of your Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<Your CSS Filename>"/>
</head>
```

Notice the `<link>` tag with `rel="stylesheet"` and `href="<Your CSS Filename>"`. This is the link tag you'll need to add to your HTML document in order to connect your CSS to your HTML. the `href` here is referencing the _relative path_ to your CSS file. If your CSS file is in a separate folder than your HTML file, you'll need to specify that in your `href`. Otherwise, you'll receive an error.

## CSS Selectors
